    "It's hard to overstate the efficacy of deep neural networks in both AI research and practice. Nearly all state-of-the-art models in AI research for vision, language, and speech utilize deep learning in some form. Outside of research, the accomplishments of large-scale neural network models have garnered significant attention from the general public. For example, you might have heard of [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), a gigantic neural language model that is capable of generating very human-like text. Or maybe you've heard of [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), a neural network capable of generating eerily realistic images from a user-input prompt. You've almost certainly heard of progress on self-driving cars - Tesla's [autopilot features](https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI), for example, uses neural networks for image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite the fact that neural networks (in combination with lots of data) have been the backbone of much of the recent progress in AI, the research community of machine learning still has a fairly weak grasp on _just why neural networks work so well_. The crux of the issue is that it is nearly always possible for a neural network to _memorize_ the training data - that is, a neural network can learn a solution which performs _perfectly_ on training data, and yet does no better than _random chance_ on data that it hasn't seen before (that is, the solution does not generalize to unseen data). Despite this fact, neural networks consistently find solutions that are able to generalize extremely well, which is why they are so pervasive in research and practice. One of the key questions in machine learning research right now is: **why does deep learning find generalizable solutions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Likely, a key factor in answering this question is the _loss landscape_ of neural networks. The loss landscape is what is traversed during neural network training via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - as such, it is extremely likely that some structure of this loss landscape is a key in understanding why neural networks generalize so well.\n",

    "NNs pose an extremely difficult optimization challenge, due to the fact that their loss landscape is non-convex and _extremely_ high-dimensional. From an optimization perspective, in a perfect world we could simply look at all possible settings of weights in a neural network and select the setting which performs the best our training data. There are two problems with this ideal setting:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. There is no guarantee that this solution would actually generalize to data outside of the training data!\n",

    "Issue 1 leaves us with approximate algorithms, such as [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent), to attempt to find a good solution in an efficient manner. This entails often starting from a random point in the hypothesis class (a random assignment of weights), and using gradient-based methods to move from one point to another within the hypothesis class, ideally such that each step reduces the training error from the previous solution.\n",
    "Early on in NN history, the \"approximate\" factor of SGD was considered a large problem - a lot of effort was devoted towards [addressing saddle-points](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2572.pdf) in NN loss landscapes, and different optimizers such as [Adam](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf) or [RMSProp](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/coursera/lecture6/lec6.pdf) were proposed, all in an attempt to better tackle the optimization problem of minimizing training data error.\n",
    "However, [Goodfellow et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6544.pdf) first noted that the training trajectory of NNs trained with SGD rarely seems to encounter local minima - training is often smooth, with error monotonically decreasing across training steps until negligible traning error is achieved.\n",
    "Additionally, recent advancements in neural networks, such as residual (or skip) connections, coupled with higher and higher overparameterization, have resulted in much smoother, and easier to optimize loss landscapes:\n",

That is to say: in most cases of NN training these days, we can find a global minimizer to the optimization problem. So issue 1 turns out not to be a major problem for us.\n",

    "Statistical learning theory attempts to give us bounds on how well we can expect a model to generalize given the complexity of the hypothesis class we're using to learn and the amount of training data we have.\n",
    "The key issue with neural networks is that they are very expressive; in fact, they are [universal function approximators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0893608089900208) - as such, standard metrics of complexity suggest that NNs are complex enough to completely memorize the entire training set without learning anything about the underlying data distribution. As a result, statistical learning theory gives us no theoretical guarantees that our NN solutions will generalize at all - how can we be sure that our solution won't just memorize (or overfit) the training data?

Thus, the only way to perform well on a training set with random labels is to _memorize_ the entire training set. [Zhang et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf) demonstrated that modern NNs are clearly capable of this, and thus they must clearly be capable of memorizing a training set with true labels as well.

    "_Key to our current understanding of generalization in neural networks is the properties of wide basins of attraction, and the role SGD plays in finding them._\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps first posed by [Hochreiter and Schimhuber, 1996](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/3304.pdf), and initially verified in modern NNs by [Keskar et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf), was the notion that **solutions which reside in flatter, wider basins of the loss landscape generalize better than solutions which reside in narrow basins.** Keskar et al. were demonstrating that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with small batch sizes converged to wider basins than SGD with larger batch sizes, and that this was correlated with the better generalization properties seen by small batch-size solutions. However, this property has been shown to be true more generally ([Dziugaite and Roy, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.11008), [Chaudhari et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01838), [Izmailov et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407)). More recently, [Huang et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03291) provided visualizations corroborating the intuition that solutions in flatter basins of attraction tend to be solutions with wider margins.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might SGD prefer basins that are flatter? A common belief is that the \"flatness\" of a solution found by SGD is\n",
    "tied to the _noise level_ of SGD.\n",
    "As mentioned above, [Keskar et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf) demonstrated that SGD with smaller batch-sizes converged to flatter minima than SGD with large batch-sizes.\n",
    "However, [Goyal et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677) showed that one could train large-batch models to good generalization if the learning rate was appropriately scaled.\n",
    "Since then, a number of works such as [Jaztersebski et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04623) and [Smith et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06451) have analyzed NN optimization with SGD as a Stochastic Differential Equation, showing that the batch-size and learning rate together determine the _temperature_ of SGD - the temperature, along with the covariance of a models gradients, determines the amount of noise present in a given run of SGD and is key to finding flatter minima. These findings suggest that SGD _implicitly_ regularizes neural networks by prefering flat minima to sharp minima, and this preference is a large part of why our networks do not overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, [Huang et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03291) proposed that one of the reasons NN training may avoid poor global minima is due to the _size_ of good global minima - that is, **the wider the basin, the more likely we are to find it during noisy optimization**. They demonstrate that the _volume_ of basins around solutions with good magnitude are _thousands of orders of magnitude_ larger than the volume of basins with poorly generalizing solutions, suggesting that finding poor basins where solutions exhibit no generalization may be _nearly impossible_ via random walks."

    "This finding was corroborated by [Gur-Ari et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04754.pdf) who showed that, early on into training, SGD would tend towards moving only in a small subspace of the loss landscape - the subspace determined by the top eigenvectors of the Hessian. This finding confirmed that the trajectory of neural networks was largely determined by a few directions in the loss landscape of high curvature, largely ignoring the many flat directions in the space. Further, Gur-Ari et al. provided evidence of a correlation between the number of classes in a classification problem and the number of non-trivial eigenvalues of the Hessian (which determined the dimension of the traversed subsapce).\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrently, [Li et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08838) found that a neural network could be optimized in a _random subspace_ of the full parameter space, and that good, generalizable solutions could still be found as long as the dimensionality of the subspace is sufficiently high. I almost want to restate that, because I find it so surprising - _you can fix your optimization to a random subspace, move **only** within that subspace, and still find a good solution_.\n",

They showed that high overlap between a random subspace and the Goldilocks zone was indicative of how well that subspace could be optimized.\n",
    "This was because random subspaces initialized in the goldilocks zone had high curvature as well, benefiting from a large ratio of positive eigenvalues in their Hessians.\n",

    "### 2. Phases of Training and the Dynamics of SGD\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of 2 distinct phases of neural network training is a fairly well established idea and has been corroborated in several different independent studies. For example, [Keskar et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04836.pdf) demonstrated that, while large-batch SGD converges to sharp minima when trained from scratch, using large-batch SGD after a certain number of epochs of small-batch SGD results in flat, wide minima - similar to what is found by models fully trained with small-batch SGD. This suggests that the benefits of small-batch SGD occur _early on_ in optimization. [Golatkar et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13277) demonstrated similar results, finding that regularization and data augmentation played a large role in the generalizability of the NN _only at the beginning of training_ - i.e., they could be removed without harm after a certain number of training epochs. Naturally, again, the converse was not true.\n",

    "Taking a slightly more \"white-box\" approach, [Achille et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08856)  utilize the fisher information matrix (FIM) of the NN to identify two distinct learning phases: one where the trace of the FIM grows rapidly, indicating the model is in regions of high curvature and that the model contains a high amount of information about the data, and a second where the FIM begins to decrease indicating a _compression_ of information about the data, and a flatter region of optimization. They find that impairments, such as image blurs, _introduced during the first phase can significantly hurt the NNs performance..._ However, when introduced in the second phase of training, they have little effect. These findings are related to the [information bottleneck in deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00810), which proposed that neural network training progresses in two phases: first maximizing the information between the inputs and the labels, then minimizing the mutual information between the input and the representations (this is framed as the neural network searching for the _minimal sufficient statistics_ with which to accurately predict the label given the input).\n",

    "[Xing et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08770) built upon this finding, demonstrating that a linear interpolation between one step of SGD and the next often yielded a convex valley; This implied that most steps of SGD are jumping over local minima, avoiding barriers in the loss landscape by hopping from one valley wall to another."

These findings suggested that _many directions in the loss landscape were very flat,_ and only a few steep directions determined the trajectory of neural networks.\n",
    "This finding was corroborated by [Gur-Ari et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04754.pdf) who showed that, early on into training, SGD would tend towards moving only in a small subspace of the loss landscape - the subspace determined by the top eigenvectors of the Hessian. This finding confirmed that the trajectory of neural networks was largely determined by a few directions in the loss landscape of high curvature, largely ignoring the many flat directions in the space. Further, Gur-Ari et al. provided evidence of a correlation between the number of classes in a classification problem and the number of non-trivial eigenvalues of the Hessian (which determined the dimension of the traversed subsapce).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most surprising recent findings regarding neural networks was demonstrated first by [Li et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08838) - they found that a neural network could be optimized in a _random subspace_ of the full parameter space, and that good, generalizable solutions could still be found as long as the dimensionality of the subspace is sufficiently high. I almost want to restate that, because I find it so surprising - _you can fix your optimization to a random subspace, move **only** within that subspace, and still find a good solution_.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is an exceptionally surprising finding as it suggests not only suggests that good solutions to NNs exist on substantially lower-dimensional planes, but that there are _many_ good solutions (since the plane can be chosen randomly). They label the \"minimum\" dimensionality of the subspace necessary to still achieve good performante the **intrinsic dimensionality** of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fort et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02581.pdf) built upon this, demonstrating the existence of what they termed the \"goldilocks zone\" - a zone in which the loss landscape of a neural network demonstrates a high amount of local convexity.\n",
    "Fort et al., showed that a good indicator for how successful optimization on a particular subspace would be was that subspace's overlap with the goldilocks zone - they found that not all subspaces can be successfully optimized and that a key factor in that is how far the origin of the _subspace_ is from the origin of the original parameter space, because that is (loosely) predictive of how much of the subspace overlaps with the goldilocks zone.\n",

A 2-D subspace is shown, with it's distance (r) from the origin of the 3-D space. Also shown are 1-D slices through the goldilocks zone, with depictions of loss curvature on these slices._\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Fort et al., demonsrated that most common initialization techniques initialize to points _within_ the Goldilocks zone, a phenomena which could partially explain the success of optimizing deep neural networks - they are consistently initialized in areas of high-convexity, which additionally lead to basins with good generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings have also been leveraged for the purposes of effiency, for example allowing more efficient forms of bayesian neural networks by performing [bayesian inference over a smaller subspace of the weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07186)."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have (only very recently) begun to get a handle on understanding certain phenomena in neural network training, and understanding properties of the loss landscapes that we optimize is key to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think, however, that I will close with a couple disclaimers. First, you might have noticed that there are many visualizations in this post from several papers, each of which attempt to highlight some intution we have about neural networks. But don't be fooled...  visualizations of neural networks can give us inuitions, but not proof. These are 2 or 3 dimensional visualizations of over 100,000 (and sometimes 1,000,000) dimensional spaces, and while they can highlight properties they _cannot_ give us the whole story. As [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/) likes to say, there could be wormholes in these figures that we just can't see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, by no means are any of these empirical findings conclusive. Many of these observations have been recorded only on small-ish neural networks, trained on datasets which, quite frankly, the community has beaten the crap out of. It remains a very open question of whether or not these findings readily generalize to state of the art models and datasets, or whether we can prove them analytically.\n",
    "Moreover, understanding the structure of neural network loss landscapes is not the final step in understanding neural networks. We are still very far from understanding _why_ these certain structural properties are present in neural network loss landscapes - the answer to which we will likely not begin to uncover until we have a much better understanding these loss landscapes still. So, while current research is likely just the tip of the iceberg, hopefully I have managed to convince you that this area of research is fascinating, and growing rapidly."
